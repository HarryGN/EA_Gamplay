## Featured Proposal for Dynamic Weather Settings

### Feature Overview:
#### A dynamic weather system that affects gameplay and the appearance of the game world, with real-time weather patterns that change over time and affect Sims' behavior and mood.

### Value Statement: 
##### The dynamic weather system will add more realism and variety to the game, making each playthrough unique and providing new challenges and opportunities for players. It will also offer additional ways to influence and role-play with Sims.
### Solution: 
##### The weather system will be implemented using real-world data, with the ability to choose from various weather patterns, such as sunny, rainy, stormy, etc. The weather will impact gameplay through affecting Sims' mood, activities, and opportunities. For example, Sims may have a harder time outdoors during a storm, or have a better time at the beach on a sunny day.
### Evaluation Statement: 
#### The benefits of a dynamic weather system are increased realism and variety, as well as new opportunities for role-playing and influencing Sims. However, there may be potential risks such as technical challenges in implementing the system, as well as balancing the impact of weather on gameplay to avoid frustration. Additionally, some players may prefer a more controlled and predictable weather system.


## Inventory Improvement 
#### Added a method to the Inventory class that removes an item from the inventory completely when its count reaches 0.  This can be implemented by using a list of dictionaries to store items in the inventory, where each dictionary represents an item with keys for name, count, and price.
